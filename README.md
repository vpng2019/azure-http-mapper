# Azure HTTP Mapper

An Azure Logic App Standard solution that accepts an XML payload through an HTTP request trigger, transforms the payload using an XSLT map, and returns the transformed XML in the HTTP response.

## Repository

**Repository name:** `azure-http-mapper`

## Solution overview

The solution contains three source/configuration artifacts:

- `HTTPMapper.json` — Logic App Standard workflow definition.
- `template.json` — ARM deployment template for the Logic App Standard host resource.
- `parameters.json` — Deployment parameter values/placeholders.

## Infrastructure template

`template.json` provisions an Azure Logic App Standard host using the `Microsoft.Web/sites` resource type.

Key characteristics present in the supplied template include:

- Resource kind: `functionapp,workflowapp`
- System assigned managed identity
- HTTPS only access enabled
- IPv4 networking
- FTPS only publishing
- TLS minimum version `1.2`
- One worker / minimum elastic instance count of `1`
- App Service Plan supplied through the `serverfarms_ASP_RGAPIM_aea9_externalid` parameter
- Hostname binding for `<logic-app-name>.azurewebsites.net`
- FTP and SCM publishing credentials disabled

## Prerequisites

Before deployment, have:

- An Azure subscription
- Permission to create/manage Logic App Standard resources and App Service Plans
- An existing App Service Plan, or a plan you will reference using `serverfarms_ASP_RGAPIM_aea9_externalid`
- The `Map.xslt` mapping file used by the workflow
- Access to GitHub repository `vpng2019/azure-http-mapper` (assuming `vpng2019` is the GitHub owner/account name)

## Deploying the ARM template

### Azure CLI

From the repository root:

```bash
az deployment group create   --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>   --template-file template.json   --parameters @parameters.json   --parameters sites_logicapp_azure_http_mapper_name=logicapp-azure-http-mapper                serverfarms_ASP_RGAPIM_aea9_externalid="/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Web/serverfarms/<APP_SERVICE_PLAN>"
```

Replace the placeholders with values from your Azure environment.

After deployment:

1. Confirm the HTTP request trigger exists.
2. Confirm the `Map.xslt` mapping is available.
3. Send a representative XML payload to the workflow endpoint.
4. Confirm the HTTP response is `200`.
5. Validate that the returned body is the XSLT transformed XML.

## Security and repository hygiene

Do not commit secrets, access keys, SAS tokens, connection strings, client secrets, or other credentials to GitHub.

The provided deployment artifacts contain environment specific Azure resource identifiers. Review `template.json` before publishing a public repository and replace or parameterize organization specific values as required by your repository's security policy.

## Git commands

Initialize the local repository:

```bash
git init
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Azure HTTP Mapper"
```

Connect it to GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/vpng2019/azure-http-mapper.git
git push -u origin main
```

To verify:

```bash
git remote -v
git status
```

## Testing checklist

- [ ] Logic App Standard host deployed
- [ ] Correct App Service Plan referenced
- [ ] HTTP request trigger available
- [ ] `Map.xslt` deployed/available
- [ ] XML request accepted
- [ ] XSLT transformation succeeds
- [ ] HTTP `200` response returned
- [ ] Response body contains the expected transformed XML
- [ ] No credentials or secrets committed to Git

## Monitoring and Operations

The ARM template enables a Logic App Standard host and contains an App Insights hidden-link tag/reference in the site resource metadata. The supplied files do not define custom alert rules, dashboards, or a dedicated operational runbook.

Recommended operational checks for the deployed solution include:

- Workflow run history
- Trigger execution status
- XSLT transformation failures
- HTTP response status
- Failed workflow runs
- Availability of the XSLT map
- Azure resource health
- Application Insights/diagnostic telemetry where enabled

Production monitoring thresholds and alert destinations should be configured according to the organization's operating model.

## Security Considerations

The ARM template contains several security-relevant settings that should be reviewed before production use.

### Positive controls represented in the supplied template

- HTTPS-only access is enabled.
- Minimum TLS is set to `1.2`.
- FTPS is configured as `FtpsOnly`.
- FTP and SCM publishing credential policies are configured with `allow: false`.
- The Logic App uses a system-assigned managed identity.

### Settings that require environment review

The template also specifies:

```text
publicNetworkAccess: Enabled
```

and an IP restriction entry allowing all traffic.

These settings may be appropriate for a public integration endpoint, but they should be reviewed against the security requirements of the target environment.

The template also contains environment-specific Azure resource identifiers. Review the repository before making it public and replace or parameterize organization-specific values where appropriate.

Never commit:

- Access keys
- SAS tokens
- Passwords
- Client secrets
- Connection strings containing credentials
- Private certificates
- API keys
